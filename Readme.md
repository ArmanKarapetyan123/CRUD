I had some problems with ts , when i was tring to run with my custom script (npm run dev).

fired error -  "Unknown file extension ".ts" for /mnt/c/Users/karap/OneDrive/Рабочий стол/Node js (EPAM)/homeworks/CRUD/src/server.ts"

tried a lot to solve this problem , but useless.

So here i got my version to made the code work

to run the API

```bash 
    npx tsx src/server.ts
```
